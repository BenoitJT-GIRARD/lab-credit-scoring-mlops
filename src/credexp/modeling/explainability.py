"""Gain importance and SHAP, on the model that is actually served.

`get_feature_names` carries the interesting part. `get_feature_names_out` refuses as soon
as one step of the pipeline lacks it, and the `InfToNan` transformer does -- so every
published SHAP figure was labelled `Feature 32`, naming no column at all. A plot that
names nothing explains nothing. The fallback is the input column order, which is exact here
because the steps before the estimator are one-to-one, and it falls through to `None`
when the widths disagree, which is safer than a wrong label.
